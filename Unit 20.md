# To explain, justify and evaluate the activities involved in IT system management and support. 

## The day-to-day activities involved in managing a live system, including:

• configuring systems to support users and applications and secure the system

• providing technical support to users

• managing users, e.g. creating accounts, allocating passwords and setting access levels

• monitoring of usage and identification of misuse

• fault-finding, use of fault recording database, 
updating solutions to faults

• setting up and running backup and restore procedures

• security procedures:

    o antivirus scans

    o firewall configuration

    o access control

    o configuring security policies

    o managing security patches and updates

    o management of software

    o centralised software rollout and updates

    o license management

**Access control** refers to **security features that control who can access resources in the operating system.** Applications call access control functions to set who can access specific resources or control access to resources provided by the application.

The type of access controls are: Mandatory Access control (MAC), Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC).

**Antivirus** software detects and prevent malicious software and viruses on your computer, it is your responsibility to ensure the software is configured and updated.​

Make sure your antivirus software is set to automatically scan all new files, such as those downloaded from the internet, external hard drive, SD card, or other type of removable media.​

Make sure your antivirus software is set to receive updates automatically.​

---

A **Firewall** is a **network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.​**

1. Most organisations initially block all access by default.​

2. Regularly audit firewall rules and policies.​

3. Keep the firewall up-to-date.​

4. Keep track of authorized users.​

---

A **security policy** (also called an information security policy or IT security policy) is **a document that spells out the rules, expectations, and overall approach that an organization uses to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data​**

• drive management:

    o imaging

    o drive mapping

• network management, protocol and IP (internet protocol) address management.

The most common IT system threats are viruses, malware, spyware, phishing, identity theft, denial of service attacks, and data theft. and by implementing the security measures mentioned above, you can protect your system from these threats. however some of these measures may be more effective than others, for example, a firewall is more effective than antivirus software, as it can block malicious traffic from entering your system, whereas antivirus software can only detect and remove malicious software that has already entered your system, but they compliment each other very well as if a malicious software does enter your system, the antivirus software can detect and remove it, and the firewall can prevent it from communicating with the attacker.

## Planning and preparation activities:

• contingency planning to deal with major problems, e.g. a major virus infection or security
breach, server hardware failure, network (local area network (LAN) and wide area network
WAN)) failure, power outages, disasters, e.g. flood, fire

• strategic long-term planning of hardware and software developments, e.g. operating
system upgrades, server hardware updating or expansion

• formulating and updating a network code of practice

• supervision and management of network staff

• advising senior management

• legal and ethical considerations applicable to the 
equivalent legislation in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, e.g. copyright, data protection.

# P2. The tools and systems that can be used to assist with IT system management and support activities. 

## System and network management tools
• The variety of systems to be managed:

    o servers and virtual PCs

    o cloud storage

    o mobile devices

    o laptops

    o desktops

    o bring your own device (BYOD).

• Tools that a system manger can use to support the day-to-day running of the system:

    o performance monitoring and management tools

    o provision of user desktop computing by various means, including server virtualisation with thin client computing and web-based applications

    o tools used to create and remotely deploy desktop disk images

    o asset management, including software licenses

    o remote desktop access and control.

## The systems used to manage user support requests:
• support request reporting systems, e.g. telephone helpdesk and web-based
reporting tools

• user support request database, allocation of requests to support technicians,
escalation of unresolved issues

• solution knowledge base and its use to support technicians

• analysis of support request data to identify issues, e.g. training needs, problem software
and hardware, scheduling of resources (time of day/week when most problems occur),
staffing issues.
